# CS2-External-Base
A simple free to use CS2 external cheat base

# About
This is my first public project, I've decided to share a stripped down version of my external cheat as a learning example for other people interested in making CS2 cheats.
From my limited play testing the cheat does not seem to get you banned, however I can not garuantee safety ( use at your own risk ).
I've based this cheat on the priciple of **READ ONLY** in an attempt to stay clear of bans
